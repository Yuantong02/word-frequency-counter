# Word Frequency Counter

A simple Python script that reads a text file and prints the top 10 most frequent words. This project is part of my learning journey toward data processing and Python programming.

## How it works

1. Reads a `.txt` file (in this case: `sample.txt`)
2. Converts all text to lowercase
3. Removes punctuation
4. Counts the frequency of each word
5. Displays the top 10 most frequent words

## Sample Output

the 12
and 9
data 7

## Skills Used

- File I/O
- String manipulation
- Dictionaries
- Sorting in Python
